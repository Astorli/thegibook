\chapter{Geometry Approximation Methods}

This is a novel class of techniques based on the idea of fast superpositioning of light transports of atomic precomputed occluders, usually with discs, spheres or surfels being taken as atomic elements. However, approximation an arbitrary scene with these building blocks can present quite a number of practical challenges. 

Furthermore, it is necessary to have this additional information in the scene representation (e.g. colors, lighting etc.) to take proper indirect lighting into account. The need to generate the additional information can place undue constraints on game production, as well as require complex implementation, and, thus, are rarely used in games at this time.
