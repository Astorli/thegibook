\chapter{Story and Storytelling}

Good storytelling is not tell but let the audience fell a good story.

Because telling is a difficult thing, nobody wants to listen someone telling a lot of words, and 

Chinese film vs Hollywood.
In <Lost in HongKong>, the actors are always try to tell you What he wants, what he fells, that's bad, and even the audience understand what he said, but this is not a feeling, and this 'kind of felling' will insist no longer. and so it will not be a great film.

A good film will let the audience always remember it, only true felling from the inside of someone can do this.

How many things do you remember the people told you? How many things do you remember you felling in your life.  

How do you want how people judge you product? By he said what you had told him in the film?
