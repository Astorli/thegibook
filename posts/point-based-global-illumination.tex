\chapter{Point-based Global Illumination}
%PBGI is similar to many-light approaches, but uses a hierarchical spatial data structure (blue circles) on all geometry, not just on lights. Doing so, the entire surface is sampled into lit points (yellow/grey for lit/unlit points), which serve as lights and occluders at the same time when being gathered (blue arrow) into a micro-framebuffer (blue box), including resolution of occlusions (blue/grey splats for lit/unlit directions).
