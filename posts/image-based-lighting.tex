\chapter{Image-based Lighting}

This chapter describes how HDR images can be used as sources of illumina- tion for computer-generated objects and scenes. This process of using images as light sources is called image-based lighting (IBL). In that IBL generally involves the use of HDR images, both the IBL process and the HDR images used for IBL are sometimes referred to as HDRI for high-dynamic-range imagery.
